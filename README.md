## Abstract

This report evaluates prompting tools across five leading AI platforms within two focused use cases: (1) **abstractive text summarization** of multi‑document inputs and (2) **technical Q\&A** involving stepwise reasoning and code. A controlled prompt protocol, rubric‑based scoring (0–5 scale), and blinded evaluation were used to compare **response quality**, **user experience (UX)**, **controllability**, **latency**, and **cost‑efficiency**. Results (illustrative, due to model and pricing drift) show broadly competitive performance across systems, with strengths distributed by task: Claude and ChatGPT lead on reasoning clarity and factuality, Gemini excels at long‑context summarization, Cohere Command provides strong retrieval‑style grounding and directness, and Llama‑3.1‑Instruct offers cost‑efficient, concise outputs with high steerability under strict templates. The report concludes with practical prompting guidelines and decision heuristics for task‑tool fit.

## 1. Introduction

Prompt engineering requires understanding how model families interpret instructions, handle constraints, and expose features such as system prompts, tools, retrieval, and safety controls. Because vendor capabilities evolve rapidly, we design a **reproducible experiment** that compares platforms on common classroom and workplace tasks. The aim is not to declare a universal “winner” but to document **trade‑offs** and provide a **decision framework** for selecting the right tool per use case.

---

## 2. Systems and Setup

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** GPT‑4/4.1‑class model with function/tool use, code execution (select plans), conversation memory, markdown rendering, and strong chain‑of‑thought refusal policies.
* **Claude (Anthropic):** Claude 3.5 Sonnet with large context window, helpful/honest/harmless tuning, and strong instruction following; excels at long‑form reasoning and citations when provided.
* **Bard / Gemini (Google):** Gemini 1.5 models with very long context and robust multimodal I/O; useful for long document synthesis and web‑style tasks.
* **Cohere Command‑R+:** Instruction‑tuned LLM optimized for retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) and enterprise use; concise, grounded style.
* **Meta Llama‑3.1‑Instruct:** Open‑weights instruct model variants; high steerability, transparent temperature/control, and cost‑efficient when hosted.

**Environment & Controls**

* Browser‑based UIs only (no API) to simulate typical student usage.
* Temperature/default randomness left at platform defaults unless specified.
* Each task run **three times** per model; best‑of‑3 chosen for quality, with tie‑breakers using rubric averages.
* **Blinded scoring:** Evaluator hides model identity during rating.
* **No external web browsing** during runs; inputs are fully self‑contained to isolate prompt following.

## 3. Tasks & Datasets

### 3.1 Use Case A — Multi‑Document Abstractive Summarization

* **Input:** Two short news‑style articles (\~700–900 words each) on the same event with differing emphasis and one contradictory detail.
* **Prompt (Template A1):**

  1. "You are a careful analyst. Produce a 180–220 word **abstractive** summary that reconciles discrepancies."
  2. "Include: (a) timeline, (b) key actors, (c) implications."
  3. "List **3 verifiable facts** with inline \[#] markers."
  4. "End with a 1‑sentence uncertainty note."
* **Evaluation Focus:** Faithfulness, compression, contradiction handling, structure, and calibration of uncertainty.

### 3.2 Use Case B — Technical Q\&A with Code

* **Input:** A leetcode‑style problem (topological sort with cycle detection) plus an edge‑case set.
* **Prompt (Template B1):**

  1. "Solve the problem; show **stepwise reasoning in headings**, but **do not** reveal hidden chain‑of‑thought—summarize reasoning instead."
  2. "Provide an **O(E+V)** algorithm, **Python 3 code**, docstring, and **5 tests**."
  3. "Explain **why** complexity holds and note 2 pitfalls."
* **Evaluation Focus:** Correctness, clarity, safety compliance (no raw CoT), code quality, tests, and runtime explanation.

**Rubric (0–5 each; average to 100‑point scale)**

* Faithfulness/Correctness (x2 weight)
* Instruction Following
* Structure & Clarity
* Controllability/Steerability
* Style/Tone Fit
* Safety/Calibration
* Latency (reverse‑scored to reward faster responses)
* Cost‑Efficiency (qualitative: Free/Pro/API proxy)

### 4.3 Qualitative Notes by Use Case

* **Summarization (A1):**

  * *Claude* offered the most balanced reconciliation of conflicting facts and clearest uncertainty statement.
  * *ChatGPT* produced the tightest 200‑word summaries with consistent structure and strong instruction adherence.
  * *Gemini* handled long context most smoothly; paragraph coherence was high but occasional over‑hedging.
  * *Command‑R+* was concise and grounded; sometimes under‑elaborated implications.
  * *Llama‑3.1* followed template reliably; minor factual slips under conflict; very responsive.
* **Technical Q\&A (B1):**

  * *ChatGPT* delivered the strongest code quality and test coverage; explanations were compact and accurate.
  * *Claude* gave excellent stepwise reasoning summaries and edge‑case analysis; slightly longer latency.
  * *Gemini* produced correct solutions but occasionally mixed styles (narrative + code) against the template.
  * *Command‑R+* favored directness; tests present but less varied.
  * *Llama‑3.1* was reliable and fast; occasional missed pitfall call‑outs.

---

## 5. User Experience (UX) & Prompting Workflow

* **UI Ergonomics:** ChatGPT and Claude UIs provided clean markdown, code fences, and easy copy; Gemini’s long‑context upload was smooth for large files. Command‑R+ and Llama UIs varied by host; API‑based deployments allow tighter control.
* **Session Memory & Tools:** ChatGPT and Claude provide robust conversation carry‑over and tool use; Gemini shines with large context. Open‑weights Llama enables custom system prompts and temperature control at low cost.
* **Safety/Refusals:** All platforms avoid revealing hidden chain‑of‑thought. High‑level reasoning summaries are consistently accepted when requested explicitly.

---

## 6. Prompting Patterns That Worked

1. **Role + Output Contract:**

   * *Pattern:* "You are an exacting analyst. Produce a {N}-word summary with sections A/B/C and 3 bullet facts."
   * *Why:* Increases structure adherence across all models.
2. **Guardrails in the Prompt:**

   * *Pattern:* "Summarize reasoning **without** revealing step‑by‑step chain‑of‑thought; provide final reasoning outline instead."
   * *Why:* Prevents refusals and keeps focus on results.
3. **Checklists & Token Budgets:**

   * *Pattern:* "Use ≤ 220 words; include uncertainty note; avoid quotes >10 words."
   * *Why:* Improves brevity and compliance.
4. **Adversarial Details:**

   * *Pattern:* "Two inputs may conflict; reconcile and flag unresolved items."
   * *Why:* Surfaces calibration differences among models.

## 7. Discussion

**Trade‑offs:**

* **Best overall controllability & code quality:** ChatGPT; excels in template compliance and testing.
* **Best for long context synthesis and document heavy tasks:** Gemini; excels with uploads and long sequences.
* **Best reasoning clarity and calibration:** Claude; excels at reconciliations and uncertainty notes.
* **Best for concise, grounded business answers / RAG setups:** Command‑R+; excels in directness and cost.
* **Best for cost‑sensitive, high‑control deployments:** Llama‑3.1; excels with transparent parameters and hosting flexibility.

**When results diverge:** Complex contradiction handling favors Claude/ChatGPT; extreme context length favors Gemini; tight budgets favor Llama/Command.

---

## 8. Limitations

* Model versions, training cutoffs, and pricing change frequently.
* Latency measured informally on shared networks.
* Human rubric scoring introduces subjectivity; multiple raters recommended.
* No web tools/RAG used in this benchmark; different rankings may emerge with retrieval enabled.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Across 2024‑style models, no single platform dominates every axis. For **summarization**, choose Claude or ChatGPT when reconciliation and calibration matter; choose Gemini for very long contexts. For **technical Q\&A with code**, ChatGPT and Claude lead, with Llama‑3.1 a strong cost‑efficient alternative and Command‑R+ a concise option for enterprise‑style answers. Effective prompt design—clear output contracts, guardrails, and checklists—consistently improves outcomes regardless of platform.
